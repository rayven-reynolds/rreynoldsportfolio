Driving clarity is sorely needed in the pace we are trying to move and Ray is a great example of that. Thank you for making us better!",

She has also jumped into O2 and O5 to organize who the correct stakeholders are, drive effective communications between stakeholders such that they can align and decide on next steps, and holds the team accountable through increased visibility and transparency of all projects she works on. She held a PDW session to coach others on effective stakeholder management to share the skillsets beyond just herself.

We launched a full company-wide initiative across PMC Matching, Web T's and C's and 2023 pricing plan in such a short timeframe across Q2 because of Ray's project management and coordination expertise. She is very impressive with her ability to level set with big discussion items across even bigger cross-functional meetings. She would set the agenda, make sure that each individual was prepared with the items they needed to address, and would always follow up with takeaways - I never had to ask anyone for a status update on where we are at with any given project because Ray was always one step ahead of us. She has made Apartment List and all of us better since being on the team - We are lucky to have you!",

Ray did such a great job at organizing the Lea Pro sessions! She was managing a ton at once but still took the time to lead the team and ensure we stay on track. The marketing team is BEYOND grateful for you!"

Engagement like this should be table stakes, and I know I'm not alone in appreciating you for making it the norm. Added Ray plug – in the 5 retros I've been in recently, Ray's project management and involvement have consistently been listed as 'what worked the best.' Thank you, Ray!"

She ensured we were providing the field with all necessary resources, that our narrative was current, and that our migration ran smoothly. This deepened level of collaboration and coordination with GTM has been vital to the success of this product—from ideation to execution—and I hope we can model future initiatives off it!"
